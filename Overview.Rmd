# Introduction

The course consists of 1-hour lectures and 2-hour tutorials. The lecture introduces a topic and the topic is then expanded upon and tackled practically in the tutorials. To pass this course, students need to take weekly pre-class quizzes that test the content of the readings and the lecture (50%). In addition, the students will have to submit a project proposal in which they describe a research project. Furthermore, students have to either submit a video of a presentation of the project proposal or present the project proposal in the last tutorial (10%).

To pass this course, students need to pass three main assessments.

* Quizzes: students need to take **weekly pre-class quizzes** that test the content of the readings and the lecture. The quizzes will be multiple choice, or fill-in-the-gaps kind of questions. There will be 10 quizzes, each counting 5% of the overall course grade (10 x 5 = **50%**).

* Project: students will have to submit a **project proposal** in which they describe a research project. (**40%**)

* Presentations: students have to **present their project proposal** in the last tutorial. Students can either submit a video of the presentation of their project proposal or present in class (if possible).  (**10%**)

# Materials


**Quizzes**
